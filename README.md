config files for my archlinux install. will update as i change my setup, mostly here so i can keep configs consistent between my desktop and laptop but anyone is more than welcome to use these configs as they please.

now i'm using gnome more than i3 so the config files i have for when i use i3 are no longer being updated, at least for now. i might return to i3 in future, but for now that's not the case.

## the stuff i use
- **os:** archlinux
- **de:** gnome
- **theme:** ultimate dark flat (violet)
- **icons:** breeze dark
- **system font:** garuda
- **terminal font:** source code pro extra light
- **shell:** zsh
- **extra stuffs:** dash to dock, cpu power manager
